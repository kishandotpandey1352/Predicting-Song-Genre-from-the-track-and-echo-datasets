# Predicting-Song-Genre-from-the-track-and-echo-datasets
#### I have 2 datasets track and echo, to classify the genre of songs
#### I have tried to clean the datasets, Combine them on few columns
Used Feature Extraction and Created 2 models: 
## **Decision Tree**
## **Logistic Regression**
#### Since the dataset is imbalanced after combining them, Also, i have tried to understand model performance before and after making the dataset balanced
